As of 2015, most of the company\u0027s revenue came from selling access to information about its members to recruiters and sales professionals. As of April 2017, LinkedIn had 500 million members in 200 countries, out of which more than 106 million members are active. LinkedIn allows members (both workers and employers) to create profiles and connections\" to each other in an online social network which may represent real-world professional relationships. Members can invite anyone (whether an existing member or not) to become a connection. The \"gated-access approach\" (where contact with any professional requires either an existing relationship or an introduction through a contact of theirs) is intended to build trust among the service\u0027s members. LinkedIn participated in the EU\u0027s International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.\"",
